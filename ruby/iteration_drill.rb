# extinct 3 years before the date provided. Update the values in extinct_animals

# 4. You've heard that the following animals might be extinct, but you're not sure.
# Check if they're included in extinct_animals, one by one:
# "Andean Cat"
# "Dodo"
# "Saiga Antelope"
# DO NOT USE ANY SPECIAL BUILT-IN METHODS.


# 5. We just found out that the Passenger Pigeon is actually not extinct!
# Remove them from extinct_animals and return the key value pair as a two item array.
# FIND THE BUILT-IN METHOD that helps you accomplish this in the Ruby documentation
# for Hashes.
