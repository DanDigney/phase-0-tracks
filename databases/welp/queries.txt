2). You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

select * from ((reviews join businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id) join users on reviews.user_id = users.id);

1|3|hey!!!|1|2|2|Amir's Towing|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|1|wow|3|2|2|Amir's Towing|3|Angela|Jolie

3.) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

select users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment from ((reviews join businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id) join users on reviews.user_id = users.id);

Bradford|Pitt|Amir's Towing|3|hey!!!

4). How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

select * from ((reviews join businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id) join users on reviews.user_id = users.id) where businesses.name ="Amir's Towing";
