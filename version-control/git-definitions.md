# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is like a time line of your program. With it, you are able to go back, change, & review your code, while also being able to control what does & does not get put into the final version of your program.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branches are like github forks within a directory/repository. They allow you to make changes to the code without having to change the actual code of the Master file, & merge them in later when you're satisfied.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commits are updates to the branch. Commit messages are generally short but detailed, & generally done in future tense.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when merged branches conflict with each other, or the master file. For an example, from trying to edit the same thing.
